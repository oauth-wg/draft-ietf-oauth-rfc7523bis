I can see this going either way.\n\nIn the SAML case, yes, there isn\u2019t an explicit typing option.  I think that leaves a choice between fixing the SAML audiences or deprecating the SAML assertions draft entirely.  Again, I could see this going either way.\n\nIn the JAR case, all the draft does is change \u201cshould be the issuer identifier\u201d to \u201cMUST be solely the issuer identifier\u201d.  I think we should do this for consistency with the other fixes and it won\u2019t be a breaking change.  But again, the working group gets to decide.\n\nAnd of course, I think we have consensus about what to do for private_key_jwt JWTs.\n\nAs I see it, the fact we\u2019re discussing legitimate choices for some of the cases shouldn\u2019t stop us from adopting the draft to get going on fixing the things that there is consensus to fix right away.\n\n",

Client requests assertion from STS (for use at compromised AS, say, to exchange for an AT for some user's resources)\n2. STS uses the token endpoint published by compromised AS (i.e., an honest AS's token ep) as `aud` when creating the assertion\n3. Client uses assertion at compromised AS (note that a compromised AS may of course show different metadata to different parties)\n=> Attacker now has an assertion that is valid at the honest AS and can be exchanged for an AT for some honest user's resources; and the client used exactly one AS and performed exactly one token exchange.\n\nI do agree that with the JWT Authorization Grant, there are additional preconditions, which likely reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited, but would argue to mitigate even small risk if it's cheap which seems to be the case here from my point of view.
