1.  Introduction

   Multiple OAuth 2.0 specifications use tokens (also known as
   "assertions") that are sent to authorization servers.  These tokens
   contain an audience value or values intended to identify the
   recipients that the token is intended for.  When the token is a JSON
   Web Token (JWT) [JWT], the audience value(s) are contained in the aud
   (audience) claim.

   When performing a security analysis of a pre-final version of the
   OpenID Federation specification [OpenID.Federation.ID4], University
   of Stuttgart security researchers Pedram Hosseyni, Dr. Ralf Küsters,
   and Tim Würtele discovered a vulnerability affecting multiple OpenID
   and OAuth specifications caused by ambiguities in the audience values
   of tokens sent to authorization servers.  The vulnerability was
   disclosed to the OAuth working group in an interim meeting in January
   2025 called for that purpose, including providing a description of
   the vulnerability [private_key_jwt.Disclosure].  A paper they
   published describing the attack is [Audience.Injection].

   This specification updates the affected OAuth specifications to
   address the security vulnerability identified.  Specifically, it
   eliminates former ambiguities in the audience values of tokens sent
   to OAuth 2.0 authorization servers.

   A general description of the update made to each specification is for
   it to require that the issuer identifier URL of the authorization
   server, as defined in [RFC8414], be used as the sole value of the
   token audience.  Furthermore, the authorization server MUST reject
   any such token that does not contain its own issuer identifier as the
   sole audience value.  An explicit type for each affected kind of
   token, as defined in [RFC8725], is also defined to facilitate
   distinguishing between tokens produced in accordance with
   specifications published prior to these updates and those
   incorporating them.  Specific updates made to each affected
   specification follow.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   All terms are as defined in the following specifications: "The OAuth
   2.0 Authorization Framework" [RFC6749], "Assertion Framework for
   OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7521],
   and "JSON Web Token (JWT)" [JWT].

2.  Updates to RFC 7521

   This section updates "Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client
   Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7521] to tighten its
   audience requirements.

   The description of the Audience parameter in Section 5.1 of [RFC7521]
   (Assertion Metamodel) is replaced by:

   Audience
      A value that identifies the party intended to process the
      assertion.  The audience MUST contain the issuer identifier
      [RFC8414] of the authorization server as its sole value.  Unlike
      the audience value specified in [RFC7521], there MUST be no value
      other than the issuer identifier of the intended authorization
      server used as the audience of the assertion; this includes that
      the token endpoint URL of the authorization server MUST NOT be
      used as an audience value.

   The description of the Audience parameter in Section 5.2 of [RFC7521]
   (General Assertion Format and Processing Rules) is replaced by:

      The assertion MUST contain an audience that identifies the
      authorization server as the intended audience, with the issuer
      identifier [RFC8414] of the authorization server as its sole
      value.  The authorization server MUST reject any assertion that
      does not contain its own issuer identifier as the sole audience
      value.

   In the list of agreements required by participants in Section 7 of
   [RFC7521] (Interoperability Considerations), "audience identifiers"
   is removed from the list.

3.  Updates to RFC 7522

   This section updates "Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants"
   [RFC7522] to tighten its audience requirements.

   The description of the Audience element in Item 2 of Section 3 of
   [RFC7522] (Assertion Format and Processing Requirements) is replaced
   by:

      The Assertion MUST contain a <Conditions> element with an
      <AudienceRestriction> element with a single <Audience> element
      that identifies the authorization server as the intended audience.
      The value of the <Audience> element MUST be the issuer identifier
      [RFC8414] of the authorization server.  Section 2.5.1.4 of
      "Assertions and Protocols for the OASIS Security Assertion Markup
      Language (SAML) V2.0" [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] defines the
      <AudienceRestriction> and <Audience> elements.  Unlike the
      audience value specified in [RFC7522], there MUST be no value
      other than the issuer identifier of the intended authorization
      server used as the audience of the assertion; this includes that
      the token endpoint URL of the authorization server MUST NOT be
      used as an audience value.

      The authorization server MUST reject any assertion that does not
      contain its own issuer identifier as the sole audience value.

   In Section 4 of [RFC7522] (Authorization Grant Example), the
   sentence:

      The intended audience of the Assertion is https://saml-
      sp.example.net, which is an identifier for a SAML Service Provider
      with which the authorization server identifies itself.

   is replaced by:

      The intended audience of the Assertion is
      https://authz.example.net, which is the authorization server's
      issuer identifier.

   In the same section, the SAML 2.0 Assertion example is replaced by:

     <Assertion IssueInstant="2024-11-17T00:53:34.619Z"
       ID="ef1xsbZxPV2oqjd7HTLRLIBlBb7"

         </AuthnContext>
       </AuthnStatement>
     </Assertion>

                    Figure 1: Example SAML 2.0 Assertion

   In the list of agreements required by participants in Section 5 of
   [RFC7521] (Interoperability Considerations), "audience identifiers"
   is removed from the list.

4.  Updates to RFC 7523

   This section updates "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0
   Client Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7523] to tighten
   its audience requirements.

   In Section 3 of [RFC7523] (JWT Format and Processing Requirements),
   Item 3, which describes the audience value, is replaced by:

      The JWT MUST contain an aud (audience) claim containing the issuer
      identifier [RFC8414] of the authorization server as its sole
      value.  The authorization server MUST have an issuer identifier to
      be used with this specification.  Unlike the aud value specified
      in [RFC7523], there MUST be no value other than the issuer
      identifier of the intended authorization server used as the
      audience of the JWT; this includes that the token endpoint URL of
      the authorization server MUST NOT be used as an audience value.
      To simplify implementations, the aud claim value MUST be a JSON
      string, and not a single-valued JSON array.  The authorization
      server MUST reject any JWT that does not contain its issuer
      identifier as its sole audience value.  In the absence of an
      application profile specifying otherwise, compliant applications
      MUST compare the audience values using the Simple String
      Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   In Section 3.1 of [RFC7523] (Authorization Grant Processing), the
   following requirement is added:

      Authorization grant JWTs MUST be explicitly typed by using the typ
      header parameter value authorization-grant+jwt or another more
      specific explicit type value defined by a specification profiling
      this specification.  Authorization grant JWTs not using the
      explicit type value MUST be rejected by the authorization server.

   In Section 3.2 of [RFC7523] (Client Authentication Processing), the
   following requirement is added:

      Client authentication JWTs MUST be explicitly typed by using the
      typ header parameter value client-authentication+jwt another more
      specific explicit type value defined by a specification profiling
      this specification.  Client authentication JWTs not using the
      explicit type value MUST be rejected by the authorization server.

   In Section 4 of [RFC7523] (Authorization Grant Example), the
   sentence:

      The intended audience of the JWT is https://jwt-rp.example.net,
      which is an identifier with which the authorization server
      identifies itself.

   is replaced by:

      The intended audience of the JWT is https://authz.example.net,
      which is the authorization server's issuer identifier.

   In the same section, the JWT Claims Set example is replaced by:

     {"aud":"https://authz.example.net",
      "iss":"https://jwt-idp.example.com",
      "sub":"mailto:mike@example.com",
      "iat":1731721541,
      "exp":1731725141,
      "http://claims.example.com/member":true
     }

                      Figure 2: Example JWT Claims Set

   In the same section, the sentence:

      The following example JSON object, used as the header of a JWT,
      declares that the JWT is signed with the Elliptic Curve Digital
      Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) P-256 SHA-256 using a key identified
      by the kid value 16.

   is replaced by:

      The following example JSON object, used as the header parameters
      of a JWT, declares that the JWT is an authorization grant JWT, is
      signed with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
      P-256 with SHA-256, and was signed with a key identified by the
      kid value 16.

   In the same section, the JOSE Header Parameters example is replaced
   by:

     {"typ":"authorization-grant+jwt","alg":"ES256","kid":"16"}

                  Figure 3: Example JOSE Header Parameters

   In the same section, the example POST body is replaced by:

     grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer
     &assertion=eyJ0eXAiOiJhdXRob3JpemF0aW9uLWdyYW50K2p3dCIsImFsZyI6Ik
       VTMjU2Iiwia2lkIjoiMTYifQ.
     eyJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovLw[...omitted for brevity...].
     J9l-ZhwP[...omitted for brevity...]

                        Figure 4: Example POST Body

   In the list of agreements required by participants in Section 5 of
   [RFC7523] (Interoperability Considerations), "audience identifiers"
   is removed from the list.

5.  Updates to RFC 9126

   This section updates "OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests"
   [RFC9126] to tighten its audience requirements.

   The paragraph describing the audience value in Section 2 of [RFC9126]
   (Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint) is replaced by:

      This update resolves the potential ambiguity regarding the
      appropriate audience value to use when employing JWT client
      assertion-based authentication (as defined in Section 2.2 of
      [RFC7523] with the private_key_jwt or client_secret_jwt
      authentication method names per Section 9 of [OpenID.Core]) that
      was described in [RFC9126].  To address that ambiguity, the issuer
      identifier URL of the authorization server according to [RFC8414]
      MUST be used as the sole value of the audience.  The authorization
      server MUST reject any such JWT that does not contain its own
      issuer identifier as the sole audience value.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described within the following
   specifications are all applicable to this document: "Assertion
   Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization
   Grants" [RFC7521], "Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants"
   [RFC7522], "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client
   Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7523], "OAuth 2.0 Pushed
   Authorization Requests" [RFC9126], "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Framework" [RFC6749], and "JSON Web Token (JWT)" [JWT].

   This specification tightens token audience requirements to prevent
   attacks that could result from exploiting audience ambiguities
   previously allowed by [RFC7521], [RFC7522], [RFC7523], and [RFC9126].
   These attacks are described in [private_key_jwt.Disclosure] and
   [Audience.Injection].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers the following media types [RFC2046] in the
   "Media Types" registry [IANA.MediaTypes] in the manner described in
   [RFC6838].
