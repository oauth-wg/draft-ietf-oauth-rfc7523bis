1.  Introduction

   Multiple OAuth 2.0 specifications use tokens (also known as
   "assertions") that are sent to authorization servers.  These tokens
   contain an audience value or values intended to identify the
   recipients that the token is intended for.  When the token is a JSON
   Web Token (JWT) [JWT], the audience value(s) are contained in the aud
   (audience) claim.

   When performing a security analysis of a pre-final version of the
   OpenID Federation specification [OpenID.Federation], University of
   Stuttgart security researchers Pedram Hosseyni, Dr. Ralf Küsters, and
   Tim Würtele discovered a vulnerability affecting multiple OpenID and
   OAuth specifications caused by ambiguities in the audience values of
   tokens sent to authorization servers.  The vulnerability was
   disclosed to the OAuth working group in an interim meeting in January
   2025 called for that purpose, including providing a description of
   the vulnerability [private_key_jwt.Disclosure].  A paper they
   published describing the attack is [Audience.Injection].

   This specification updates the affected OAuth specifications to
   address the security vulnerability identified.  Specifically, it
   eliminates former ambiguities in the audience values of tokens sent
   to OAuth 2.0 authorization servers.

   A general description of the updates made is to require that the
   issuer identifier URL of the authorization server, as defined in
   [RFC8414], be used as the sole value of the audience of the JWT
   client authentication assertion.  Furthermore, the authorization
   server rejects any JWT client authentication assertion that does not
   contain its own issuer identifier as the sole audience value.  An
   explicit type for each affected kind of token, as defined in
   [RFC8725], is also defined to facilitate distinguishing between
   tokens produced in accordance with specifications published prior to
   these updates and those incorporating them.  Specific updates made to
   each affected specification follow.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   All terms are as defined in the following specifications: "The OAuth
   2.0 Authorization Framework" [RFC6749], "Assertion Framework for
   OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7521],
   and "JSON Web Token (JWT)" [JWT].

2.  Updates to RFC 7521

   This section updates "Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client
   Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7521] to tighten its
   audience requirements.

   The description of the Audience parameter in Section 5.1 of [RFC7521]
   (Assertion Metamodel) is replaced by:

   Audience
      A value that identifies the party intended to process the
      assertion.  The issuer identifier of the authorization server, as
      defined in [RFC8414], can be used to indicate that the
      authorization server is a valid intended audience of the
      assertion.

3.  Updates to RFC 7522

   This section updates "Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants"
   [RFC7522].  It tightens its audience requirements for SAML
   authorization grants and it deprecates the use of SAML assertions for
   client authentication.

   The text and example in Section 2.2 of [RFC7522] (Using SAML
   Assertions for Client Authentication) is replaced by:

      It is RECOMMENDED that SAML Bearer Assertions not be used for
      client authentication.

   The description of the Audience element in Item 2 of Section 3 of
   [RFC7522] (Assertion Format and Processing Requirements) is replaced
   by:

      The Assertion MUST contain a <Conditions> element with an
      <AudienceRestriction> element with an <Audience> element that
      identifies the authorization server as the intended audience.  The
      client is responsible for ensuring that the audience of the
      Assertion is appropriate for the authorization server to which it
      is sent.  This MAY be the issuer identifier of the authorization
      server, the token endpoint URL of the authorization server, or a
      SAML Entity ID.  Section 2.5.1.4 of "Assertions and Protocols for
      the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0"
      [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] defines the <AudienceRestriction> and
      <Audience> elements.  The authorization server MUST reject any
      assertion that does not contain its own identity as the intended
      audience.

4.  Updates to RFC 7523

   This section updates "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0
   Client Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7523] to tighten
   its audience requirements.

   In Section 3 of [RFC7523] (JWT Format and Processing Requirements),
   Item 3, which describes the audience value, is replaced by:

      The JWT MUST contain an aud (audience) claim containing a value
      that identifies the authorization server as the intended audience.
      Two cases are differentiated:

      a.  For the authorization grant, the client is responsible for
          ensuring that the audience of the JWT assertion is appropriate
          for the authorization server to which it is sent.  An
          authorization server MAY be identified by either its issuer
          identifier or its token endpoint URL.

      b.  For client authentication, the aud (audience) claim value MUST
          use the issuer identifier [RFC8414] of the authorization
          server as its sole value.  The authorization server MUST have
          an issuer identifier to be used with this specification.
          Unlike the aud value specified in [RFC7523], there MUST be no
          value other than the issuer identifier of the intended
          authorization server used as the audience of the JWT; this
          includes that the token endpoint URL of the authorization
          server MUST NOT be used as an audience value.  The
          authorization server MUST reject any JWT that does not contain
          its issuer identifier as its sole audience value.

      In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
      applications MUST compare the audience values using the Simple
      String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of RFC 3986
      [RFC3986].

   In Section 3.2 of [RFC7523] (Client Authentication Processing), the
   following requirement is added:

      Client authentication JWTs SHOULD be explicitly typed by using the
      typ header parameter value client-authentication+jwt or another
      more specific explicit type value defined by a specification
      profiling this specification.

      The introduction of strong typing for JWTs (using explicit typ
      values) serves as a signal to distinguish between tokens produced
      in accordance with specifications published prior to these updates
      and those incorporating them.  However, the primary security
      protection comes from the tightened audience requirements.  Since
      strong typing alone does not prevent the attacks described in
      [private_key_jwt.Disclosure] and [Audience.Injection], the use of
      explicit typing is RECOMMENDED for clients, enabling them to
      signal their intention of sending a JWT conforming to the
      requirements herein.  This approach balances security signaling
      with practical deployment considerations, avoiding disruption to
      client deployments that already conform to the tightened audience
      requirements but have not yet adopted explicit typing.

   In Section 4 of [RFC7523] (Authorization Grant Example), the
   sentence:

      The intended audience of the JWT is https://jwt-rp.example.net,
      which is an identifier with which the authorization server
      identifies itself.

   is replaced by:

      The intended audience of the JWT is https://authz.example.net,
      which is the authorization server's issuer identifier.

   In the same section, the JWT Claims Set example is replaced by:

     {
       "aud": "https://authz.example.net",
       "iss": "https://jwt-idp.example.com",
       "sub": "mailto:mike@example.com",
       "iat": 1731721541,
       "exp": 1731725141,
       "http://claims.example.com/member": true
     }

                      Figure 1: Example JWT Claims Set

   In the list of agreements required by participants in Section 5 of
   [RFC7523] (Interoperability Considerations), an agreement on
   "audience identifiers" is no longer needed for client authentication
   JWTs.

   The additional example in the following subsection is added after
   Section 4 of [RFC7523]

4.1.  Client Authentication JWT Example

   The following example illustrates what a client authentication JWT
   and token request using it would look like.

   The example shows a JWT issued and signed by the OAuth client
   identified as https://client.example/.  The intended audience of the
   JWT is https://authz.example.net, which is the authorization server's
   issuer identifier.  The JWT is sent as part of a token request to the
   authorization server's token endpoint at https://authz.example.net/
   token.oauth2.

   Below is an example JSON object that could be encoded to produce the
   JWT Claims Set for a client authentication JWT:

     {
       "aud": "https://authz.example.net",
       "iss": "https://client.example/",
       "sub": "https://client.example/",
       "iat": 1752702206,
       "exp": 1752705806
     }

   The following example JSON object, used as the header parameters of a
   JWT, declares that the JWT is a client authentication JWT, is signed
   with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) P-256
   with SHA-256, and was signed with a key identified by the kid value
   16.

     {
       "typ": "client-authentication+jwt",
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "16"
     }

   To present the JWT with the claims and header parameters shown above
   as part of an access token request, for example, the client might
   make the following HTTPS request (with extra line breaks for display
   purposes only):

    POST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
    Host: authz.example.net
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=authorization_code&
    code=n0esc3NRze7LTCu7iYzS6a5acc3f0ogp4&
    client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3A

5.  Updates to RFC 9126

   This section updates "OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests"
   [RFC9126] to tighten its audience requirements.

   The paragraph describing the audience value in Section 2 of [RFC9126]
   (Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint) is replaced by:

      This update resolves the potential ambiguity regarding the
      appropriate audience value to use when employing JWT client
      assertion-based authentication (as defined in Section 2.2 of
      [RFC7523] and as updated by Section 4 with the private_key_jwt or
      client_secret_jwt authentication method names per Section 9 of
      [OpenID.Core]) that was described in [RFC9126].  To address that
      ambiguity, the issuer identifier URL of the authorization server
      according to [RFC8414] MUST be used as the sole value of the
      audience.  The authorization server MUST reject any such JWT that
      does not contain its own issuer identifier as the sole audience
      value.

      The introduction of strong typing for JWTs (using explicit typ
      values) serves as a signal to distinguish between tokens produced
      in accordance with specifications published prior to these updates
      and those incorporating them.  However, the primary security
      protection comes from the tightened audience requirements.  Since
      strong typing alone does not prevent the attacks described in
      [private_key_jwt.Disclosure] and [Audience.Injection], the use of
      explicit typing is RECOMMENDED for clients, enabling them to
      signal their intention of sending a JWT conforming to the
      requirements herein.  This approach balances security signaling
      with practical deployment considerations, avoiding disruption to
      client deployments that already conform to the tightened audience
      requirements but have not yet adopted explicit typing.

      Client authentication JWTs SHOULD be explicitly typed by using the
      typ header parameter value client-authentication+jwt or another
      more specific explicit type value defined by a specification
      profiling this specification.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described within the following
   specifications are all applicable to this document: "Assertion
   Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization
   Grants" [RFC7521], "Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants"
   [RFC7522], "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client
   Authentication and Authorization Grants" [RFC7523], "OAuth 2.0 Pushed
   Authorization Requests" [RFC9126], "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Framework" [RFC6749], and "JSON Web Token (JWT)" [JWT].

   This specification tightens token audience requirements to prevent
   attacks that could result from exploiting audience ambiguities
   previously allowed by [RFC7521], [RFC7522], [RFC7523], and [RFC9126].
   These attacks are described in [private_key_jwt.Disclosure] and
   [Audience.Injection].

Appendix A.  Document History

   [[ to be removed by the RFC Editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   -04

   *  Applied editorial suggestions by Jamshid Khosravian.

   -03

   *  Update OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods IANA entries
      with reference to this specification

   *  Relaxed client requirement to use strong typed JWTs.  SHOULD
      instead of MUST.

   *  Do not restrict the "aud" claim's type.  Allow it to be an array
      with a single member.

   *  Advise the client to ensure that the audience of an assertion
      authorization grant makes sense with respect to where it’s being
      sent.

   *  Updates to the abstract and introduction to (hopefully) better
      reflect the more targeted scope of the work.

   *  Remove JWTs for Client Authentication example replacement (not
      worth it for including typ in the encoded JWT header).

   *  Add request to update existing OAuth URI registrations to add
      reference to this specification for the four relevant URNs.

   *  Fixup the new Client Authentication JWT Example.

   -02

   *  Added Filip Skokan as an author.

   *  Applied Brian Campbell's suggestions made at IETF 122.
      Specifically:

      -  Focused RFC 7523 updates on JWT client authentication case.

      -  Described client responsibilities for the audience value of
         authorization grants.  No longer mandate that the audience for
         authorization grants be the issuer identifier, so as to make a
         minimum of breaking changes.

      -  Deprecated the use of SAML assertions for client
         authentication.

   -01

   *  Reworked to make updates to RFC 7523, rather than replacing it.

   *  Removed updates to RFC 9101.

   *  Added reference to the University of Stuttgart paper
      [Audience.Injection].

   -00

   *  Initial working group draft, replacing draft-jones-oauth-
      rfc7523bis-00.
